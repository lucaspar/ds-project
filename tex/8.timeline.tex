\section{Timeline}

With synchronization checkpoints every Monday, we have reached the fourth week as planned in our proposal:

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{lcl}
    \textbf{Date}    & \multicolumn{1}{l}{\textbf{Week}} & \textbf{Tasks}                                        \\ \hline
    \st{Sep. 14} & \st{1}                        & \st{Dataset selection, download, and cleanup.}                \\
    \st{Sep. 21} & \st{2}                        & \st{Handcrafted feature extraction.}                          \\
    \st{Sep. 28} & \st{3}                        & \st{Implement baseline classifier; milestone.} \\
    Oct. 5  & 4   & Improvements on baseline; metrics extraction. \\
    Oct. 12 & 5   & Alternative model implementation.             \\
    Oct. 19 & 6   & New metrics and comparison.                   \\
    Oct. 27 & 7   & Final report writing and presentation.        \\
    Nov. 2  & 8   & Further experiments / improvements.           \\
    Nov. 9  & 8.5 & Revision and delivery.                       
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The next steps include extracting further metrics by running the existing classifiers on FMA-Medium. Following that, we will combine the best classifiers into a new ensemble version and tune their hyperparameters.
