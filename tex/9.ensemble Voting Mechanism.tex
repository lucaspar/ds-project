% As shown in the , the features derived from MFCC combined with SVM classifiers provide the highest accuracy so far. The numbers will be more accurate if we train them with K-fold methods if we have enough time.

% \subsubsection{Analysis}
As the nature of ensemble, we simply implement it with voting mechanism. One thing worth mentioning is that if there is a tie situation(in this case in our Ensemble One it will be 2-2-1 vote), we select the genre that the top-f1 classifier agrees with.
