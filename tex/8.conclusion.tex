\section{Conclusion}

In this case with performance results we have as evidence, we find out that the model, RBF SVC, outperformed our ensemble classifiers and is capable of classifying music genres. However, an ensemble model composed by different classifiers such as our Ensemble Two, composed by SVM, Linear Regression and MLP might still generalize better and outperform RBF SVC on a different dataset.
