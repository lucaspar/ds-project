\section{Future Work}

Neural networks are likely to perform better for a same dataset, but it is hard to assert their advantage across datasets. Because of the learned feature extraction, they may overfit to their training data and have stability issues across datasets with different properties. With these potential weaknesses enlightened, however, it would be interesting to see the comparison of a neural-network approach against an ensemble on the same and different datasets in a leave-one-out cross validation.

A second possible follow-up is the usage of further metadata for genre classification, exploring the tracks not only for what they are (as a time series), but exploring beyond that and add information on how they are perceived by the public (e.g. popularity, demographics of listeners) and the creators (e.g. title, album, release date, lyrics). Works exploring this kind of data can go beyond genre classification and even serve as predictors of when, where, and for whom a given track is more likely to succeed.
