\section{Experiment Settings}

For training purposes, we split the FMA-Small dataset into 8:1:1, respectively training, validation, and testing.

\subsection{Models}
After the feature extraction, we make them as input and send them to 13 models for training process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Logistic Regression (LR)
    \item Random Forests (RF)
    \item K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    \item 2x Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    \item Support Vector Machines (SVM)\\2x Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels
    \item Decision Tree Classifier (DT)
    \item AdaBoost
    \item Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
    \item Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
\end{itemize}
