\section{Experiment Settings}

For training purposes, we split the FMA-Medium dataset into 8:1:1, respectively training, validation, and testing.

\subsection{Models}
After the feature extraction, we make them as input and send them to following models for training process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logistic Regression (LR)
    \item Random Forests (RF)
    \item K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    \item Support Vector Classification (SVC)
    \item DecisionTreeClassifier (DT)
    \item AdaBoostClassifier (AdaBoost)
    \item GaussianNB (NB)
    \item QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis (QDA)
\end{itemize}
