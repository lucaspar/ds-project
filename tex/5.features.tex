% \subsection{Data Cleaning}

From the FMA-Medium dataset we select \texttt{trackid} as our object and \texttt{genre-top} as our ground truth. FMA-Medium dataset contains 25000 tracks in 16 different genre categories, which are Blues, Classical, Country, Easy Listening, Electronic, Experimental, Folk, Hip-Hop, Instrumental, International, Jazz, Old-Time Historic, Pop, Rock, Soul-RnB, and Spoken.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}

We are currently using the following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) \cite{Li2006}
    \item Root Mean Square Energy (RSME) \cite{Tao}
    \item Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) \cite{Li2006, Nanni2016, Hoffmann2016, Lim2012}
    \item Spectral Centroid, Bandwidth, Contrast, Roll-Off \cite{Li2006, Li2005}
    \item Chroma Features
    \item Tonal Centroid Features (Tonnetz) \cite{Harte2006}
\end{itemize}

In addition to those, the features that we have found in the literature but are currently not extracted:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histogram \cite{Li2006}
    \item Central Moments (CM)
    \item Tempo
\end{itemize}
