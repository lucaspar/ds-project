% Course Project Policies:
% Grading distribution
%       Proposal Paper (10%), Milestone Paper (30%), Final Presentation (20%)
%       Final Paper (30%), Code/Data (10%), Discussion bonus (+3%)
% Teaming: each graduate team should have 2 to 3 students.

% • Proposal
%   o Paper (PDF): title, problem definition, potential solutions, data sources,
%       proposed evaluation methods, project plan/timeline
% • Milestone
%   o Paper (PDF): introduction, related work, problem definition, one or more
%       method that has been used, some other potential solutions, data and
%       experiment settings, evaluation methods, preliminary results and
%       experimental analysis, timeline.
%   o Presentation (PPTX) for selective projects: in class
% • Final
%   o Paper (PDF): introduction, related work, problem definition,
%       solutions and methods that have been used, data and
%       experiment settings, evaluation methods, experimental
%       results and analysis (tables and figures), discussion and
%       future work, conclusions
%   o Presentation (PPTX): in class.
% • Data and code package (ZIP):
% 
% • The papers (PDF) should be formatted according to the new Standard ACM Conference
% Proceedings Template: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template
% 
% • There will be -33% penalty if the paper is not formatted correctly.
% 
% • Deadlines
%       Every project required item is due at midnight (11:55pm) with
%       some grace period. There will be -33% penalty for each 24h past the deadline.

% ========================= GRADING =========================

% Both milestone paper and final paper will be graded using the project paper rubric.
% Note that the ACM template adoption is a pre-assumed metric for all the papers.

% The project presentation will be graded as follows:
%   Introduction: 15% Provide context. What questions are being addressed?
%   Solution/Method: 30%
%       What did you do? Why did you choose this method? What tools and techniques
%       did you use?
%   Data and Experiments: 10% What data did you use? Are your experimental methods reliable?
%       Evaluation and Results: 30% What evaluation did you do? Do your conclusions match your results?
%   Presentation Quality: 15% Clarity of speaking (5%), organization (5%), and visuals (5%).

% The project paper will be graded as follows:
%   Introduction: 15%
%       Provide context and motivation. What questions are being addressed? Why are
%       these questions interesting or important?
%   Related Work: 10%
%       What other methods have addressed these or similar questions? How do these
%       methods differ from your method?
%   Solution/Method: 25%
%       What did you do? What tools and techniques did you use? Was any innovation
%       attempted?
%   Data and Experiments: 10%
%       What data did you use? Are your experimental methods reliable? What
%       preprocessing was done the data?
%   Evaluation and Results: 25%
%       Did you properly evaluate your experiments? Did you test for statistical
%       significance? Do your conclusions match your results?
%   Writing Quality: 15% Clarity of writing (5%), organization (5%), and grammar (5%).
