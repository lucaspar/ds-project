abstract = {The music recommendation systems, currently in use rely upon ratings, likes and generic generalization of genres. This produces far from ideal recommendations and possibly constricts the exploration span of the listener, thus limiting one's library to a set of popular artists and titles. In order to refine the recommendation system, scientific attributes of the track must be taken into account. These attributes can be represented in the form of vector parameters. These vector parameters can be meaningfully defined using a specially designed FFT algorithm and the derived data is sent to the main server which will serve as an open ended system. Thus resulting in a system which leads to an indirect recommendation performed by another user client.},

abstract = {Audio event recognition, the human-like ability to identify and relate sounds from audio, is a nascent problem in machine perception. Comparable problems such as object detection in images have reaped enormous benefits from comprehensive datasets - principally ImageNet. This paper describes the creation of Audio Set, a large-scale dataset of manually-annotated audio events that endeavors to bridge the gap in data availability between image and audio research. Using a carefully structured hierarchical ontology of 632 audio classes guided by the literature and manual curation, we collect data from human labelers to probe the presence of specific audio classes in 10 second segments of YouTube videos. Segments are proposed for labeling using searches based on metadata, context (e.g., links), and content analysis. The result is a dataset of unprecedented breadth and size that will, we hope, substantially stimulate the development of high-performance audio event recognizers.},

abstract = {Any automatic music genre recognition (MGR) system must show its value in tests against a ground truth dataset. Recently, the public dataset most often used for this purpose has been proven problematic, because of mislabeling, duplications, and its relatively small size. Another dataset, the Million Song Dataset (MSD), a collection of features and metadata for one million tracks, unfortunately does not contain readily accessible genre labels. Therefore, multiple attempts have been made to add song-level genre annotations, which are required for supervised machine learning tasks. Thus far, the quality of these annotations has not been evaluated. In this paper we present a method for creating additional genre annotations for the MSD from databases, which contain multiple, crowd-sourced genre labels per song (Last.fm, beaTunes). Based on label co-occurrence rates, we derive taxonomies, which allow inference of top-level genres. These are most often used in MGR systems. We then combine multiple datasets using majority voting. This both promises a more reliable ground truth and allows the evaluation of the newly generated and preexisting datasets. To facilitate further research, all derived genre annotations are publicly available on our website.},

The single chapters of this textbook explain the general architecture of multimedia information retrieval systems; various metadata languages like Dublin Core, RDF, or MPEG; pattern recognition through Markov models, unsupervised learning, and pattern clustering; various indexing approaches to audio and video streams; interaction and control; the protection of content and user privacy; and search effectiveness and efficiency. The authors emphasize high-level features and show how these features are used in mathematical models to support the retrieval process.

abstract = {Since musical genre is one of the most common ways used by people for managing digital music databases, music genre recognition is a crucial task, deep studied by the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research community since 2002. In this work we present a novel and effective approach for automated musical genre recognition based on the fusion of different set of features. Both acoustic and visual features are considered, evaluated, compared and fused in a final ensemble which show classification accuracy comparable or even better than other state-of-the-art approaches. The visual features are locally extracted from sub-windows of the spectrogram taken by Mel scale zoning: the input signal is represented by its spectrogram which is divided in sub-windows in order to extract local features; feature extraction is performed by calculating texture descriptors and bag of features projections from each sub-window; the final decision is taken using an ensemble of SVM classifiers. In this work we show for the first time that a bag of feature approach can be effective in this problem. As the acoustic features are concerned, we propose an ensemble of heterogeneous classifiers for maximizing the performance that could be obtained starting from the acoustic features. First timbre features are obtained from the audio signal, second some statistical measures are calculated from the texture window and the modulation spectrum, third a feature selection is executed to increase the recognition performance and decrease the computational complexity. Finally, the resulting descriptors are classified by fusing the scores of heterogeneous classifiers (SVM and Random subspace of AdaBoost). The experimental evaluation is performed on three well-known databases: the Latin Music Database (LMD), the ISMIR 2004 database and the GTZAN genre collection. The reported performance of the proposed approach is very encouraging, since they outperform other state-of-the-art approaches, without any ad hoc parameter optimization (i.e. using the same ensemble of classifiers and parameters setting in all the three datasets). The advantage of using both visual and audio features is also proved by means of Q-statistics, which confirms that the two sets of features are partially independent and they are suitable to be fused together in a heterogeneous system. The MATLAB code of the ensemble of classifiers and for the visual features extraction will be publicly available (see footnote 1) to other researchers for future comparisons. The code for acoustic features is not available since it is used in a commercial system.},

abstract = {Efficient and intelligent music information retrieval is a very important topic of the 21st century. With the ultimate goal of building personal music information retrieval systems, this paper studies the problem of intelligent music information retrieval. Huron [10] points out that since the preeminent functions of music are social and psychological, the most useful characterization would be based on four types of information: genre, emotion, style, and similarity. This paper introduces Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms (DWCH) for music feature extraction for music information retrieval. The histograms are computed from the coefficients of the dbg Daubechies wavelet filter applied to 3 s of music. A comparative study of sound features and classification algorithms on a dataset compiled by Tzanetakis shows that combining DWCH with timbrai features (MFCC and FFT), with the use of multiclass extensions of support vector machine, achieves approximately 80{\%} of accuracy, which is a significant improvement over the previously known result on this dataset. On another dataset the combination achieves 75{\%} of accuracy. The paper also studies the issue of detecting emotion in music. Rating of two subjects in the three bipolar adjective pairs are used. The accuracy of around 70 {\%} was achieved in predicting emotional labeling in these adjective pairs. The paper also studies the problem of identifying groups of artists based on their lyrics and sound using a semi-supervised classification algorithm. Identification of artist groups based on the Similar Artist lists at All Music Guide is attempted. The semi-supervised learning algorithm resulted in nontrivial increases in the accuracy to more than 70{\%}. Finally, the paper conducts a proof-of-concept experiment on similarity search using the feature set. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

More specifically, overcomplete dictionaries are learned and sparse coefficient vectors are extracted to optimally approximate the slow temporal modulations of the training music recordings. The sparse coefficient vectors are then projected to the principal subspaces of their within-class and between-class covariance matrices. Decisions are taken with respect to the minimum Euclidean distance from the class mean sparse coefficient vectors, which undergo the aforementioned projections. The application of majority voting to the decisions taken by 10 individual classifiers, which are trained on the 10 training folds defined by stratified 10-fold cross-validation on the GTZAN dataset, yields a music genre classification accuracy of 84.96{\%} on average.

We review how GTZAN has been used in MGR research, and find few indications that its faults have been known and considered.
